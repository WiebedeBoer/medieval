						<h1>Commerce</h1>
						<p>
						Common goods such as foodstuffs and raw materials are produced by settlers on the virgates of lands. These can be produced everywhere, but the yield of timber varies according to the climate. Desert and steppe yield little timber. Some vills have local bonus buildings that give a higher production yield for some resources.
